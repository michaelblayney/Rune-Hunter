# Rune-Hunter

Group project for COMP313 and MDDN301

Rune Hunter is a 2D isometric view dungeon crawler developed in Unreal Engine. The core gameplay revolves around the player character fighting through a series of randomly loaded, pre generated, themed rooms using various abilities and a dash to to kill the enemy AI's and move on to the final boss room. The player has 1 life and a set amount of health that depletes when hit by an enemy mesh or projectile. The first level and final boss room are set but all levels in between are chosen from a random pool of premade maps. Each level spawns a set of random enemies with a variety of attacks and movements that actively attack or lay traps for the player. Once all enemies in a room are killed by the players attacks the player can freely move through the exit gate into a new level. The player can change their primary attack by walking over powerups that are scattered throughout the vairous levels. Once the final boss has been defeated the player will receive a victory screen.

External Libraries Used:

No external libraries were used for this project. Only libraries loaded into any basic Unreal project were utilized. With the exception of a single transparency plugin for making the player visible when there is a wall between character mesh and camera; all textures, materials and meshes were made by the design team. All code was done from scratch using either base Unreal functions or software team coded C++ functions.
